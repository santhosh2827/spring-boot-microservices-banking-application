# API Gateway
## Introduction
The API Gateway is a microservice responsible for routing requests to the appropriate backend services. It acts as a single entry point for all client requests and provides features such as load balancing, security, and monitoring.

## Technologies Used

### Spring Boot
Spring Boot is used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the configuration and deployment process by providing a set of default configurations and a wide range of features such as embedded servers, security, and monitoring.

### Spring Cloud Gateway
Spring Cloud Gateway is used to route requests to the appropriate backend services. It provides features such as load balancing, security, and monitoring.

### Eureka Server
Eureka Server is a service registry used for service discovery. It allows microservices to register themselves at runtime and discover other registered services.

### Spring Security
Spring Security is used to secure the API endpoints. It provides authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the application.

### Lombok
Lombok is a Java library that helps to reduce boilerplate code by generating common methods like getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString at compile time.

## API Endpoints
The API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate backend services. The endpoints are defined in the `application.properties` file and the `GatewayConfig.java` class.

## Error Handling
The API Gateway uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Common status codes include:
- `200 OK` - The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request` - The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- `404 Not Found` - The requested resource was not found.
- `500 Internal Server Error` - An error occurred on the server.

## Security
The API Gateway uses Spring Security to secure the API endpoints. Authentication and authorization are handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Configuration
The service configuration is managed using Spring Cloud Config, which allows for centralized and externalized configuration management across all microservices.

## Monitoring
Spring Boot Actuator is used for monitoring and managing the application. It provides various endpoints to check the health, metrics, and other operational information of the service.

## Logging
Logging is configured using Logback, which is the default logging framework in Spring Boot. It provides powerful and flexible logging capabilities.

## Testing
JUnit and Mockito are used for unit and integration testing. These frameworks provide a comprehensive set of tools for writing and running tests.

## Build and Deployment
The project uses Maven for build automation and dependency management. The service can be packaged as a Docker container for deployment in a containerized environment.
